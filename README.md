This package defines a macro that approximates the syntax for associated consts that is used in nightly Rust builds, but it turns the consts into functions so no nightly features are required. Therefore, we can have the appearance (but not the advantages) of associated consts in stable Rust.

This package will be irrelevant after September 2015, assuming associated consts get stabilized when Rust 1.3-stable is released.
